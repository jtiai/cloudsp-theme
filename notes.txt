TODO
----
* try and clean up rendering of relbar menu - maybe w/ optional icons
* way to specify "redirects" from old pages - would probably have to be javascript based.
* better docs for the extensions


Misc
----
* thread about ReST content showing up in search results -- https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sphinx-users/LTXwbmX0CeE
